# Survey-the-customers-2

Required Assessment for SDE Intern (Frontend)
 
 
You need to build a frontend application to survey the customers in a shop. We set these 
questions in a Kiosk inside the shop. We have 5 questions that need to be asked to every 
customer in the shop. Questions are, 

1. How satisfied are you with our products? (Rating type, 1-5) 
2. How fair are the prices compared to similar retailers? (Rating type, 1-5) 
3. How satisfied are you with the value for money of your purchase? (Rating Type, 1-5) 
4. On a scale of 1-10 how would you recommend us to your friends and family? (Rating 
Type, 1-10) 
5. What could we do to improve our service? (Text Type)


Together, these three files work together to create a frontend application for surveying customers in a shop. The HTML provides the structure, the CSS enhances the visual appeal, and the JavaScript adds the necessary functionality to make the survey interactive and user-friendly.
